A Simple Weather React App!

Utilizing OpenWeatherMap.com's API, I allow users to input their city, state, and country and return some basic weather information.

This demonstrates my ability to utilize the fetch method to pull data from the web, convert it into JSON, then store it in my react app's state where I can then pull data and show.

TODO:
1. It is not a very 'pretty' app, I would like to add more styling
2. I would like to create prettier icons that better show the current weather. (i.e. the day/sun are not pleasing to look at)
3. Give more detailed data like sun up, sun down. Really just dig into all of the data that is fetched and see if there is more to give.
4. Just to be a silly boy I want to allow someone to enter long/lat. It's useless but fun.
